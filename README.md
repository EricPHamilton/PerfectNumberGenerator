# PerfectNumberGenerator
This is a small program to generate a list of the perfect numbers.

A perfect number is defined as a number who's factors (excluding the number itself), sum up to the number.
For example, 6 has 3 factors excluding itself. 1, 2, and 3. 1+2+3 = 6, therefore, 6 is a perfect number.
